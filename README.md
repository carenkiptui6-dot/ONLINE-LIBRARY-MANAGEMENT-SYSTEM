                                    ONLINE LIBRARY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
  This project implements the Online Library Management System using Object Oriented Progamming Principles in C++. It allows libaies to mange users who access,borrow ad return borrowed books to the libray effortlessly.
                                 Object Oriented Progamming Design Pinciples
In this poject i implemented OOP design principles in C++ to the poject and they include:
Encapsulation-the data mambers such as book Id, author name and title are private and are accessed using public methods.
Abstraction-the classes represent real world entities(the user, book and library)
Composition- the Online Library Management system is composed of user, books, and library.
                        Features implemented
I implemented features in the system such as;
adding and removing books
seaching for books by various criteria
managing user accounts with borowing and returning capabilities.
                        How to compile and and the program
1. Open Dev-C++.
2. Create a new C++ Console Application.
3. Add the source files (`main.cpp`, `tests.cpp`) and header files (`Book.h`, `User.h`, `Library.h`) to the project.
4. Save the project.
5. Click **Execute → Compile & Run** (or press **F11**).
6. The program output will be displayed in the Dev-C++ console window.
                        Test cases implemented
   a) Positive test cases-the system includes test cases that are valid such as;
Add a book successfully
User borrows an available book
User returns a borrowed book
   b) Negative test cases-the system includes test cases that are invalid such as;
Borrow a book that does not exist
Borrow a book already borrowed
Return a book that was not borrowed
