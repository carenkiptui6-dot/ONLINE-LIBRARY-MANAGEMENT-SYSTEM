                                    ONLINE LIBRARY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
  This project implements the Online Library Management System using Object Oriented Progamming Principles in C++. It allows libraies to manage users who access,borrow ad return borrowed books to the libray effortlessly.

In this poject i implemented OOP design principles in C++ to the project and they include:
1. Encapsulation-the data mambers such as book Id, author name and title are private and are accessed using public methods.
2. Abstraction-the classes represent real world entities(the user, book and library)
3. Composition- the Online Library Management system is composed of user, books, and library.
I implemented features in the system such as;
Adding and removing books,
Seaching for books by various criteria,
Managing user accounts with borowing and returning capabilities.

   How to compile and run the program
a) Open Dev-C++.
b) Create a new C++ Console Application.
c) Add the source files (`main.cpp`, `tests.cpp`) and header files (`Book.h`, `User.h`, `Library.h`) to the project.
d) Save the project.
e) Click **Execute → Compile & Run** (or press **F11**).
f) The program output will be displayed in the Dev-C++ console window.

    The Test cases implemented.
   a) Positive test cases-the system includes test cases that are valid such as;
1. Add a book successfully,
2. User borrows an available book,
3. User returns a borrowed book,
   b) Negative test cases-the system includes test cases that are invalid such as;
1. Borrow a book that does not exist,
2. Borrow a book already borrowed,
3. Return a book that was not borrowed.
