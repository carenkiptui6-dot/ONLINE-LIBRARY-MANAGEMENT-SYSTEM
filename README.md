                                    ONLINE LIBRARY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
  This project implements the Online Library Management System using Object Oriented Progamming Principles in C++. It allows libraies to manage users who access,borrow ad return borrowed books to the libray effortlessly.
In this poject i implemented OOP design principles in C++ to the project and they include:
1. Encapsulation-the data mambers such as book Id, author name and title are private and are accessed using public methods.
2. Abstraction-the classes represent real world entities(the user, book and library)
3. Composition- the Online Library Management system is composed of user, books, and library.
I implemented features in the system such as;
1. adding and removing books
2. seaching for books by various criteria
3. managing user accounts with borowing and returning capabilities.
                        How to compile and and the program
1. Open Dev-C++.
2. Create a new C++ Console Application.
3. Add the source files (`main.cpp`, `tests.cpp`) and header files (`Book.h`, `User.h`, `Library.h`) to the project.
4. Save the project.
5. Click **Execute → Compile & Run** (or press **F11**).
6. The program output will be displayed in the Dev-C++ console window.
                        Test cases implemented
   a) Positive test cases-the system includes test cases that are valid such as;
1. Add a book successfully
2. User borrows an available book
3. User returns a borrowed book
   b) Negative test cases-the system includes test cases that are invalid such as;
1. Borrow a book that does not exist
2. Borrow a book already borrowed
3. Return a book that was not borrowed
                    Author information
